# Groovy Division by Zero Exception

This repository demonstrates a common error in Groovy: division by zero.  The `bug.groovy` file contains the faulty code, resulting in a `groovy.lang.GroovyRuntimeException`. The solution, in `bugSolution.groovy`, illustrates how to correctly handle this using a try-catch block, preventing unexpected program termination.

## How to Run

1. Save the provided code as `bug.groovy` and `bugSolution.groovy`. 
2. Run the files using the Groovy interpreter (e.g., `groovy bug.groovy`).
3. Observe the error thrown by the initial version, and the successful execution of the solution version.
